    # About IT-Tools

    This wonderful website, made with ❤ by [Corentin
    Thomasset](https://corentin.tech?utm_source=it-tools&utm_medium=about) ,
    aggregates useful tools for developer and people working in IT. If you find
    it useful, please feel free to share it to people you think may find it
    useful too and don't forget to bookmark it in your shortcut bar!

    IT Tools is open-source (under the GPL-3.0 license) and free, and will
    always be, but it costs me money to host and renew the domain name. If you
    want to support my work, and encourage me to add more tools, please consider
    supporting by [sponsoring me](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/cthmsst).

    ## Technologies

    IT Tools is made in Vue.js (Vue 3) with the the Naive UI component library
    and is hosted and continuously deployed by Vercel. Third-party open-source
    libraries are used in some tools, you may find the complete list in the
    [package.json](https://github.com/CorentinTh/it-tools/blob/main/package.json)
    file of the repository.
